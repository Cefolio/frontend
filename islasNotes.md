//----Not only are standard network request techniques employed, the code is organized in such a fashion that the student demonstrated proper use of container vs presentational components or other industry standards, conventions or patterns. ----//

I chose to mostly use container components because how things function is my biggest priority. I have some presentational components inside my container components but don't have any DOM markup except for wrapping divs. They are stateful and serve as data sources. 

//----Student incorperated a third party event/animation library like unto Greensock, Anime, React-motion etc.---//

I used Greensock to animate the login/register pages.

//----Student's code was organized at the component level, proper usage of state and props are demonstrated throughout the project, the UI is composed of small reusable components, proper usage of useState and useEffect hooks are clearly incorporated and correctly implemented.  Student used Array methods to dynamically render HTML elements.---//

I need to have someone review my code to see if I met the requirements for meeting state and props. Once we are able to get info from the backend I will start to use Array methods to render html elements. I used small, reusable components.

//------Student has set up component management for the forms in the app that makes sense for each form. Student made the decision to use a third-party library, like Formik, or not, and can defend their decision. Some form validation is in place.----//

I used Formik because it keeps my code DRY. The only time I did not use Formik was for my search bar. I didn't have a lot of experience creating a search bar so I wanted to stick with some basic form management that was second nature to me in order to get it done.
