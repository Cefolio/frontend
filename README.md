# Chefolio
Chefolio is a portfolio for chefs. To get this up and running make sure you fork and clone the Repo.
After, make sure you use yarn install to get all of the dependencies. To see it in your browser, use yarn start.

This project was a collaborative effort from Chris Vasquez, Tiffany Simionescu, and Isla McNeill. Chris and Tiffany were lead on the front end of this project and it is because of them that this project is running at all. Isla did the forms. She tried, Formik, useForm and in the end we scrapped it all to use regular Vanilla React Forms. Lesson to learn from this: Don't try to do cool stuff when you are in a time crunch. Just get the job done.
